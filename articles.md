# Bitcoin Articles

Many amazing articles have been written about Bitcoin. I am aware that trying to
link to all of them is futile, but I want to make an effort and at least
highlight some of them. I highly recommend the [literature listed][sni] at the
Nakamoto Institute, the selection of [articles read][guy-episodes] by
Guy Swann, and the [writings collected][brh-writings] by Adam Taché.

One of the best articles to read if you are new to Bitcoin is [The Bullish Case
for Bitcoin][bullish-case], which outlines why there are very good reasons to be
optimistic about Bitcoin's future.

## The Difficulty of Understanding Bitcoin

Bitcoin isn't exactly easy to understand. Some of the reasons for this
phenomenon are explored in the following articles:

{% include articles.html category='The Difficulty of Understanding Bitcoin' %}

I explore the multi-disciplinary nature of Bitcoin in [21 Lessons].

[21 Lessons]: http://21lessons.com

## Bitcoin's Uniqueness

Why Bitcoin, and not something else? Because Bitcoin matters, Bitcoin is unique,
Bitcoin is fair, and Bitcoin is way better than you think.

{% include articles.html category="Bitcoin's Uniqueness" %}

## Money

If you aren't ready yet to read [books on money][moneybooks], these articles are a
great entry point to start learning about the purpose and history of money.

{% include articles.html category='Money' %}

I wrote about money and the history and downfall of money in [Lesson
11][lesson-11] and [Lesson 12][lesson-12].

[lesson-11]: https://21lessons.com/11

## Proof-of-work

In my opinion, proof-of-work is one of the most misunderstood parts of the
Bitcoin puzzle. It solves multiple problems, making it one of the most integral
parts of the system. The following articles explore proof-of-work in more
detail:

{% include articles.html category='Proof-of-work' %}

I wrote about how I changed my view on proof of work in [Bitcoin's Energy
Consumption: A shift in perspective][energy-consumption] and in [Lesson 17][lesson-17].

## Bitcoin's Identity

What is Bitcoin? This question is surprisingly difficult to answer. It is a
network (Bitcoin), money (bitcoin), software (various implementations), an idea
(the white paper), an immutable record of ownership (Bitcoin's ledger, aka the
"block chain"), a movement, a monetary revolution, and more.

{% include articles.html category="Bitcoin's Identity" %}

I explore Bitcoin's identity in [Lesson 4][lesson-4] and [Bitcoin's
Gravity][gravity].

## A Social Revolution

Bitcoin is not only a technological, financial, and monetary phenomenon, it is
also a global revolution. Bitcoin captures the hearts and minds of people all
over the world, changing society in the process. Today, tens of thousands of
"closet bitcoiners" exist worldwide, and Bitcoin has developed a zealous cult
following.

{% include articles.html category='A Social Revolution' %}

I explore some of the societal impacts in [Lesson 1][lesson-1] and wrote about
some of these impacts in [The Rise of the Sovereign
Individual][rise-of-the-sovereign-individual].

[lesson-1]: https://21lessons.com/1

## Who Controls Bitcoin?

One of the first responses of people learning about Bitcoin is "Yeah yeah I get
it... but who controls it?" The question of control is not an easy one to
answer, because you have to understand the whole system on a pretty deep level
to answer it. The following articles might help.

{% include articles.html category="Who Controls Bitcoin?" %}

I explore the question of control (and censorability) in [Lesson 6][lesson-6]
and in [The Magic Dust of Cryptography][magic-dust].

## Bitcoin as a Living Organism

Ralph Merkle famously called Bitcoin ["the first example of a new form of
life."][dao-merkle]. Others developed this idea further, which is - in my
opinion - one of the most useful analogies to understand Bitcoin.

{% include articles.html category="Bitcoin as a Living Organism" %}

I explore the idea of Bitcoin as a living organism in [Proof of
Life][proof-of-life] and [Bitcoin's Habitats][bitcoins-habitats].

[proof-of-life]: https://dergigi.com/2019/08/07/proof-of-life/
[bitcoins-habitats]: https://dergigi.com/2020/03/01/bitcoin-s-habitats/

## Cypherpunks

Bitcoin is cypherpunk technology. Made by a cypherpunk, based on cypherpunk
ideas. I consider exposure to the ideas and ideals of cypherpunk culture
essential.

{% include articles.html category="Cypherpunks" %}

## Privacy

Without digital cash, a cashless society is a surveillance society. While
privacy in Bitcoin is not a given, there are various ways to transact privately.
The following resources discuss these possibilities, why the right to transact
privately is essential, and why it has to be protected.

{% include articles.html category="Privacy" %}

## Misc

The following are what I consider excellent articles that didn't fit into one
of my arbitrarily chosen categories above.
