time is now.

### Am I too late?

No. Everyone thinks that they \"[missed the
bus](https://bitcoin-resources.com/assets/images/missed-the-bus.jpg).\"

It is never too late to adopt electricity. It is never too late to adopt
the internet. It is never too late to adopt the [Bitcoin
Standard](https://bitcoin-resources.com/books/the-bitcoin-standard).

### ...but isn't Bitcoin too slow?

No. Bitcoin travels at the speed of light, just like all information. In terms
of final settlement, the important metric to look at is the settlement
assurance. A trustless settlement mechanism has to use [proof-of-work][pow].
Bitcoin absolutely dominates in terms of hashrate, having its hands on virtually
100% of the global hashrate.[^hashrate]

### ...but isn't Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme?

No. Bitcoin does not meet the defin­i­tion of a Ponzi scheme. Many shitcoins do,
but Bitcoin is different.

### Where do I buy bitcoin?

Good question. It depends on where you are in the world and what kind of
risks and privacy tradeoffs you are willing to accept.

### Is Bitcoin bad for the environment?

Bitcoin is the [holy grail for power
grids](https://www.seetee.io/podcast/S2E10/shaun-connell-bitcoin-mining-is-the-holy-grail-for-power-grids/)
and can incentivise investments in renewable energy. Human flourishing rests on
our ability to use energy effectively.[^aepstein] Bitcoin's incentive structure
leads to a higher demand for energy and thus the proliferation of cheap and
abundant energy.

### Is Bitcoin used by criminals?

Yes. All tools are. As of 2020, [around
0.34%](https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2021-crypto-crime-report-intro-ransomware-scams-darknet-markets) of
use is linked to criminal activity. This is lower than the
estimated [2-5%](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/money-laundering/overview.html) of
the fiat banking system with their custom-made [teller
windows](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hsbc-probe-idUSBRE8BA05M20121212).

    Criminals](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/bitcoin-is-not-for-criminals/)

### What wallet should I use?

The most important thing to learn is that holding your own keys is
paramount. After that, it depends.

    Wallet](https://www.citadel21.com/not-your-keys-not-your-bitcoin)

### How do I run a node?

Short answer: download [Bitcoin
Core](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/) and run it. Long answer: it depends on what you want to do with your node.

    Node?](https://armantheparman.com/why-should-you-run-your-own-bitcoin-node/)

### Are all bitcoiners crazy?

Maybe. However, more and more reasonable people and CEOs are starting to
see the value of bitcoin.

### Won\'t governments just ban it?

Some will, some won\'t. In any case, [outlawing
speech](https://21lessons.com/6/) is futile, as was the Prohibition.  The
[implications](https://dergigi.com/law) of an outright ban are ridiculous.
Bitcoin is equivalent to [free speech](https://dergigi.com/speech).
