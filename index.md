**TL;DR:** Read [The Bitcoin Standard][bitcoin-standard] and [The Bullish
Case for Bitcoin][bullish-case].

---

## Essentials

Start at the beginning, and read -- or at least skim --
the 8 pages which gave birth to Bitcoin:

- [Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System][bitcoin-whitepaper] by Satoshi Nakamoto

To get a grasp on Bitcoin you will have to read a book or two.  If you only want
to read one book, you can't go wrong with Saifedean's **[The Bitcoin
Standard][the-bitcoin-standard]**. Bitcoin is money, so understanding [The
Ethics of Money Production][the-ethics-of-money-production] is paramount to
understanding what Bitcoin is about. If you need a crash-course in economics,
read [Economics in One Lesson][economics-in-one-lesson] by Henry Hazlitt.

[the-bitcoin-standard]: {{ '/books/the-bitcoin-standard' | absolute_url }}
[the-ethics-of-money-production]: {{ '/books/the-ethics-of-money-production' | absolute_url }}

{% include books.html category='essentials' %}

If you prefer a shorter introduction, read and listen to the following:

- [The Bullish Case for Bitcoin][bullish-case] by Vijay Boyapati ([audio
version][bullish-case-audio])
- [The Stories We Tell About Money][aantonop-stories] by Andreas Antonopoulos

## Articles

Many amazing articles have been written about Bitcoin. Trying to
link to all of them is futile. The following is an effort to highlight
at least some of them. For a more comprehensive list of resources please
refer to the literature listed at the [Satoshi Nakamoto Institute][sni] and the
selection of articles read by [Bitcoin Audible][guy-episodes].

One of the best articles to read if you are new to Bitcoin is [The Bullish Case
for Bitcoin][bullish-case], which outlines why there are very good reasons to be
optimistic about Bitcoin's future.
