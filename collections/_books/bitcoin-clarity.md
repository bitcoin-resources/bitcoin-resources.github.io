quote: "The most common way to describe proof-of-work is as an algorithmically chosen computer puzzle, with arbitrary difficulty, which can be adjusted with high granularity. But that's a lot of words so let's just think of it as something like a Rubik's Cube for computers."

description: "Kiara's book is the solution to the struggle many people face when trying to understand Bitcoin. This method focuses on mental models, visuals, and systems thinking instead of code as a way to explain Bitcoin without price hype or industry jargon. Understanding Bitcoin doesnâ€™t come by someone telling you exactly what Bitcoin is, but by giving you a new perspective to see it from."
