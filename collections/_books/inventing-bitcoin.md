description: "Most people, upon first hearing about Bitcoin, donâ€™t really understand it. Is it magical Internet money? Where does it come from? Who controls it? Why is it important? For Yan, understanding all the things that come together to make Bitcoin work - the physics, math, cryptography, game theory, economics, and computer science - was a profound moment. In this book, he hopes to share this knowledge with you in a very simple and easy to understand way. With nothing but a high school level math background, he will walk you through inventing bitcoin, step by step."
